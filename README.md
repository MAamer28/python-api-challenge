Module 6 Challenge

## Description
This activity is broken down into two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy.

### Part 1: WeatherPy
In this deliverable, a Python script was created to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. 

Scatter plots were created to display the relationship between latitude and weather variables (temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed).

### Part 2: VacationPy
In this deliverable, the aforementioned weather data was analyzed to determine ideal vacation destinations. The selected cities were then further analyzed to research the first choice hotel for each city.
